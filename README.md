Diabetes and Cancer Incidence among Adults in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)

Project Overview
This project investigates the association between diabetes status and cancer incidence in Hispanic/Latino adults using data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The study examines cancer risk across various diabetes measures such as HbA1c levels, insulin resistance, and diabetes duration.

Methods
Assessment of Cancer Incidence
Cancer diagnoses were obtained through state cancer registries, with 715 primary invasive cancers identified over a median follow-up of 10.97 years.

Assessment of Diabetes
Data Sources: Self-reports, clinical observations, and laboratory measures.
Measures:
Diabetes defined using ADA guidelines:
HbA1c ≥6.5%, fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or 2-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL.
Pre-diabetes: HbA1c 5.7%–6.4%, fasting plasma glucose 100–125 mg/dL.
HOMA-IR calculated as:
HOMA-IR
=
Fasting Glucose (mg/dL)
×
Fasting Insulin (mU/L)
405
HOMA-IR= 
405
Fasting Glucose (mg/dL)×Fasting Insulin (mU/L)
​
 
Groups:
Diabetes: ≤10 years, >10 years.
HOMA-IR: Normal (≤1.9), Significant resistance (2.0–2.9), Elevated resistance (≥3.0).
Covariates
Demographics: Age, sex, education level, country of birth.
Lifestyle: Physical activity (GPAQ), smoking history, alcohol use.
Clinical: BMI (calculated from measured height and weight).


Statistical Analysis
Software: SAS 9.4.
Design Considerations: Survey weights, cluster sampling, and stratification to ensure representativeness.
Methods:
Descriptive statistics: Weighted means, standard errors, and percentages.
Cancer incidence rates: Calculated per 1,000 person-years.
Survey-weighted Cox proportional hazards models:
Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diabetes status and cancer incidence.
Stratified Analysis: Conducted by Hispanic/Latino heritage group.

Results
Overall Cancer Risk:
Baseline diabetes status: 13% increased risk (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87–1.44).
HbA1c Levels:
5.7%–6.4%: 39% increased risk (HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.07–1.79).
≥6.5%: 20% increased risk (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.91–1.57).
Insulin Therapy: Associated with a 31% increased cancer risk (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 0.86–2.00).
HOMA-IR ≥3.0: 25% increased risk of cancer (HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.96–1.63).

Conclusion
This study found that diabetes status and specific diabetes measures (HbA1c, insulin therapy, and HOMA-IR) are associated with an increased risk of cancer. Although results were not statistically significant, they highlight the need for further research on the relationship between diabetes and cancer in Hispanic/Latino populations.
