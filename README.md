Diabetes and Cancer Incidence among Adults in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)

Project Overview
This project investigates the association between diabetes status and cancer incidence in Hispanic/Latino adults using data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The study examines cancer risk across various diabetes measures such as HbA1c levels, insulin resistance, and diabetes duration.


Statistical Analysis
Software: SAS 9.4.
Design Considerations: Survey weights, cluster sampling, and stratification to ensure representativeness.
Methods:
Descriptive statistics: Weighted means, standard errors, and percentages.
Cancer incidence rates: Calculated per 1,000 person-years.
Survey-weighted Cox proportional hazards models:
Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diabetes status and cancer incidence.
Stratified Analysis: Conducted by Hispanic/Latino heritage group.

Results
Overall Cancer Risk:
Baseline diabetes status: 13% increased risk (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.87–1.44).
HbA1c Levels:
5.7%–6.4%: 39% increased risk (HR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.07–1.79).
≥6.5%: 20% increased risk (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.91–1.57).
Insulin Therapy: Associated with a 31% increased cancer risk (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 0.86–2.00).
HOMA-IR ≥3.0: 25% increased risk of cancer (HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.96–1.63).

Conclusion
This study found that diabetes status and specific diabetes measures (HbA1c, insulin therapy, and HOMA-IR) are associated with an increased risk of cancer. Although results were not statistically significant, they highlight the need for further research on the relationship between diabetes and cancer in Hispanic/Latino populations.
